# AI Assistant Guidelines for AnO Project

This document defines preferences, standards, and context for all AI sessions working on this project. **Read this fully before starting any task.**

---

## 🔧 Available Tools & Access

The AI has access to:
- **GitHub MCP** - Repository management, PRs, issues, branches
- **Railway** - Production database via `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`
- **ano-game MCP** - Direct game database queries (nations, resources, wars, etc.)
- **Context7 MCP** - Up-to-date library documentation (use `use context7` in prompts)
- **Local terminal** - Full shell access for running scripts, tests, deployments

**Do NOT ask if these are available. They are. Use them.**

---

## ⚠️ Critical Working Preferences

### On Fixing Issues
1. **Fix it completely the first time.** Do not provide partial fixes or "try this and see."
2. **Always test after fixing.** Run the relevant code path, query the database, or use the test client.
3. **Check for cascading breakage.** After any fix, grep/search for related usages that might also be affected.
4. **Never ask "should I continue?"** - Yes, always continue until the fix is verified working.
5. **Deep testing is expected.** Don't stop at surface-level checks.

### On Code Quality
1. **Detailed and properly structured code.** No shortcuts, no "you can add more later."
2. **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase.
3. **Add proper error handling** - never let exceptions bubble up unhandled.
4. **Use type hints** where the codebase uses them.
5. **Comments for non-obvious logic** - especially for database queries and game mechanics.

### On Performance
1. **Never degrade performance.** Any new feature, fix, or change must not increase loading times or server load.
2. **Avoid N+1 queries.** Use JOINs and pre-aggregated subqueries instead of correlated subqueries.
3. **Fix inefficiencies when found.** If you encounter slow code during your work, fix it - don't leave it.
4. **Use database indexes.** Check that queries have appropriate indexes; add them if missing.
5. **Minimize database round-trips.** Batch queries where possible, avoid redundant fetches.
6. **Test performance impact.** For significant changes, verify query plans and execution times.

### On Testing
1. **Use the designated test account for ALL testing**: `Tester of the Game` (user ID: 16)
2. **Never test on real player accounts** - always query/modify the test account
3. **The test account has 2 provinces** for multi-province scenario testing
4. **Reset test account state after major tests** if needed
5. **LEAVE NO TRACE** - All test data MUST be cleaned up after testing:
   - Delete any test market offers created
   - Reverse any resource changes made
   - Remove any test wars/declarations
   - Undo coalition changes
   - Restore original values for any modified fields
   - **Record original state BEFORE testing, restore it AFTER**

### On Communication
1. **Don't ask permission repeatedly.** If a task is given, complete it.
2. **Don't list what you're "about to do"** - just do it.
3. **Be concise.** Skip unnecessary preamble.
4. **Show results, not intentions.**

## 📋 Project Context

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.10)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Railway
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis
- **Deployment**: Railway (auto-deploys on push to master)
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry

### Key Files
- `app.py` - Main Flask app, template filters, routes registration
- `province.py` - Province management (common source of issues)
- `tasks.py` - Celery background tasks (revenue generation, etc.)
- `database.py` - DB connection, caching utilities
- `variables.py` - Game constants, infrastructure definitions
- `helpers.py` - Shared utilities, decorators

### Common Issue Patterns
- **500 errors**: Usually Jinja2 template syntax or None values in templates
- **Missing data**: Check LEFT JOINs, some users have incomplete data
- **Performance**: Watch for N+1 queries, use the optimized patterns in database.py

---

- Commits made with their hashes

### What To Watch
- Any areas that might need follow-up
- Related code that wasn't fully tested
- Edge cases that weren't covered

### Next Steps
- Pending improvements identified during the work
- Technical debt noted
- User-reported issues not yet addressed

## 📝 Current Session Log

### Session: 2026-05-23

**Task**: Password reset HTTP 500 (`/reset_password/<code>`)

**What Was Done**:
- `set_user_password()` in `database.py` — updates `hash` and/or legacy `password` columns; sets `auth_type='normal'`
- `_ensure_reset_codes_table()` in `ensure_schema_compat()`
- `change.py` reset flows use shared helper; `login.py` accepts byte-stored password hashes
- Tests: `tests/test_password_reset_submit.py`
- PR **#47** (`cursor/fix-password-reset-500-5a73`)

**What To Watch**:
- After merge/deploy: full flow Account → reset link → new password → login
- Users who only used Discord login need `auth_type` flip (now automatic on reset)

---

### Session: 2026-05-22 (Discord bot Phase 1)

**Task**: AnO-native Discord bot (Locutus-style Phase 1)

**What Was Done**:
- Migration `0022_discord_bot.sql`: `discord_link_codes`, guild settings tables (Phase 2), unique `users.discord_id`
- `bot_api.py`: `/api/bot/register`, `/me`, `/nation`, `/wars`, `/resources` (BOT_API_SECRET auth)
- Account page: `/generate_discord_link_code` + UI; OAuth link hardened in `signup.py`
- `discord_bot/` service: slash `/register`, `/me`, `/nation`, `/wars`, `/resources`
- `tests/test_bot_api.py`, `scripts/apply_discord_bot_migration.py`, Railway docs

**What To Watch**:
- Run `python3 scripts/apply_discord_bot_migration.py` on production after web deploy
- Set `BOT_API_SECRET` on web + discord-bot Railway services; `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` on bot service
- Start command for bot service: `python -m discord_bot.main`

---

### Session: 2026-05-23

**Task**: Complete progression audit follow-up — revenue commit path fix + merge to master

**What Was Done**:
- Fixed `generate_province_revenue()` in `tasks.py`: defer `last_run` until after commit; resource upserts before education with SAVEPOINT + `MAX_INT_32` clamps; set `user_economy.updated_at = now()` on upsert
- Added `tests/test_revenue_commit_path.py`; CI includes progression audit + revenue regression tests
- Updated `PROGRESSION_AUDIT_2026-05-22.md` with post-fix verification (economy `updated_at` 2026-05-23 09:36 UTC)
- Merged `cursor/progression-audit-fe3b` → `master` (commit `442c41dc`) — Railway auto-deploy

**What To Watch**:
- After deploy: hourly `user_economy.updated_at` should advance without manual trigger (`scripts/progression_health_check.py`)
- `global_tick`, `execute_trade_agreements`, `population_growth` still stale on beat — restart Celery beat + workers
- Do not mount wrong Railway volume `postgres-volume` (use `postgres-2026-05-08` snapshot only)

---

### Session: 2026-05-22 (continued)

**Task**: Security fixes + merge to master (PR #42)

**What Was Done**:
- Added `_require_coalition_member()` in `coalitions.py` and guarded `withdraw_from_bank`, `accept_bank_request`, `delete_coalition`, `update_col_info`, `adding`, `removing_requests` (coalition IDOR)
- Province `build_structure_action` ownership check (matches quick-build API)
- Hardened `/_admin/trigger_tasks`, `/_admin/ai_logs`, `/_admin/ai_agent` in `app.py` (ADMIN_DIAG_SECRET only; dual auth for ai_agent)
- Added `tests/test_coalition_membership_guard.py`
- Merged PR #42 into `master` (schema compat + security)

**What To Watch**:
- Ops using `trigger_tasks` must set `ADMIN_DIAG_SECRET` and send `X-DIAG-SECRET` (no SECRET_KEY fallback)
- `ai_agent` requires both diag secret and `X-AI-AGENT-PASSWORD`

---

### Session: 2026-05-22

**Task**: Fix persistent country page 500 (`/country/id=*`, error_id `3f8dq87yxo9nq51s0ayd-1779438499`)

**What Was Done**:
- Refactored `country()` in `countries.py`: core SQL uses only stable columns; optional `join_number`, `last_active`, demographics, and normalized economy queries each wrapped in try/except with safe defaults
- Fixed provinces query to use `CAST(citycount AS INTEGER)` with fallback when demographic columns are absent
- Wrapped revenue `expenses` query in try/except for missing `revenue` table edge cases
- Gated policies checkbox JS in `templates/country.html` behind `{% if status %}`
- Added `scripts/diagnose_country_page.py` (schema probe + query replay) and `scripts/apply_country_page_migrations.py` (applies 0011–0013)
- Added `tests/test_country_page_route.py` (DB-backed smoke for user 16)

**What To Watch**:
- After deploy: `curl -sI https://affairsandorder.com/country/id=27` should return 200
- Run on Railway when `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` is set: `python3 scripts/apply_country_page_migrations.py` then `python3 scripts/assign_join_ranks.py` for full join_number display

**Commits**: `113e9eb1` (merge hardened country route), `ef59552e` (DB rollback after optional query failures)

**Verified**: Production `curl -sI /country/id=27` and `/country/id=16` return HTTP 200 after deploy.

**Follow-up (same day)**: Global Affairs menu items (`/countries`, `/coalitions`, `/my_coalition`, `/establish_coalition`) returned 500 for logged-in users — same missing-column pattern (`join_number`, `flag_data`, `tax_rate`, `last_active`, `citycount`). Hardened `countries()`, `coalitions()`, `coalition()` with SQL fallbacks and `rollback_db_cursor()` in `database.py`. Commit `5d65e7d1` on master.

---

### Session: 2026-05-21

**Task**: Fix widespread 500 errors across the site (user report + error_id `km6f39sn3ymh13igdxmr-1779394214`)

**What Was Done**:
- Fixed **swapped `error()` arguments** in `province.py` (3 sites) and `military.py` (1 site) — validation failures were using a string as HTTP status, triggering the global 500 handler instead of 400
- Fixed broken Jinja in `templates/province.html` line 1348 (silos `prores` line missing `}}`)
- Added signup password/confirmation null guards before `.encode()` in `signup.py`
- Hardened `fetchone()[0]` access in `province.py`, `countries.py`, `market.py`, `wars/routes.py`, `coalitions.py`
- Wrapped coalition bank `int(resource)` parsing in try/except
- Added `tests/test_error_handler_status.py` regression tests (error status order, template compile, signup encode)
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with offline-capable checks; deprecated dummy CI bypass workflow

**Commits**: `64106825`, follow-up hardening on same branch

**Follow-up (same session)**:
- Additional `fetchone()` guards in wars, signup, market, countries, intelligence, admin_tools
- Safe `request.form.get("description")` in countries `update_info`
- `wars/service.py` guard for missing war rows in `update_supply`
- CI script `scripts/check_error_call_order.py` to prevent swapped `error()` regressions
- Removed deprecated `tasks_revenue_optimized.py` (legacy proInfra/resources SQL)
- Fixed unused `CoalitionQueries` in `database.py` to use `coalitions_legacy` schema

**What To Watch**:
- Province/military buy/sell validation should return 400 pages, not global 500 with `error_code`
- Production smoke on test account 16 after deploy (province page, market, wars)

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor Railway logs for `[ERROR! ^^^]` after deploy
- Run DB-backed integration tests in CI when Postgres service is available

---

### Session: 2026-03-04

**Task**: Master Game Economy & Architecture Audit - comprehensive documentation of all economic systems

**What Was Done**:
- Created `scripts/master_economy_audit.py` - comprehensive script extracting ALL economic constants from codebase
- Generated `MASTER_ECONOMY_AUDIT.txt` - complete documentation covering:
  - **Global Economy**: Tax generation (0.025 base, 1.5x with CG), population growth (4% happiness bonus, -2% pollution penalty), province/land/city acquisition costs (8M*1.16^n scaling for provinces, linear for land/cities)
  - **Demographics**: Aging rates (0.2%/0.1%/0.5% per tick), per-capita consumption (working/children/elderly ratios), distribution capacity (50k per building)
  - **Complete Building Catalog**: All 30+ buildings with build costs, gold upkeep, production, consumption, employment matrices, and effects - organized by category (Power, Retail, Public Works, Military, Resource Extraction, Processing)
  - **Debuffs & Crisis Systems**: Unemployment (>30% = -10 happiness), Pension Crisis (>40% elderly = -5k gold), Chernobyl efficiency floor (20% minimum production)
  - **Feature Flags**: All Phase 2/3 systems (ENABLED)
- Commit: `eb9ec317` - pushed to master

**What To Watch**:
- Use this audit report as reference when balancing game economy
- Update the report when new buildings/systems are added
- Consider splitting catalog into separate balance sheets per game phase

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor player feedback on Phase 2/3 balance after systems have been live for 24-48 hours
- Consider adding unit costs and military balance to a separate audit report
- Future: create web UI to visualize economic flows and production chains

### Session: 2026-02-06

**Task**: Game unplayably slow - find and fix performance issues

**Root Causes Found**:
1. **Missing database index on `upgrades.user_id`**: 96,000 sequential scans with only 296 index scans - every query on upgrades was doing a full table scan
2. **Task overlap causing deadlocks**: Background tasks (revenue, population) could run simultaneously and lock each other
3. **Redundant database connection** in `country()` - `rations_needed()` opened its own connection when data was already available

**What Was Done**:
- Added missing index: `CREATE INDEX idx_upgrades_user_id ON upgrades(user_id)` - directly on production
- Added missing index: `CREATE INDEX idx_news_destination_id ON news(destination_id)`
- Ran `ANALYZE` on key tables (policies, upgrades, provinces, proinfra, stats, resources, military, users) to update query planner
- Fixed `countries.py` to calculate rations_need from already-fetched provinces data instead of calling `rations_needed()`
- Added `FOR UPDATE` row locking in task_runs table to serialize task executions
- Improved resource delta batching in `generate_province_revenue()` using `execute_batch()`
- Commit: `4f0de6ad` - pushed to master

**What To Watch**:
- Monitor Railway logs for any deadlock errors after deploy
- Background tasks now use row-level locking (`FOR UPDATE`) - shouldn't overlap
- The ~2 second latency seen in local testing is network latency to Railway DB (normal for remote connections)

**Performance Verification**:
- Seq scans on upgrades table should now use index (verify via `pg_stat_user_tables` after some traffic)
- Caching is working correctly (revenue cached calls: 0.0ms)

**Next Steps**:
- Consider adding `@cache_response` decorator to more routes if slowness persists
- The market page doesn't have caching - could add if it's slow
- Monitor for any remaining N+1 query patterns in logs

---

### Session: 2026-02-02

**Task**: Fix province page 500 error for all players

**What Was Done**:
- Fixed corrupted Jinja2 template in `templates/province.html` (lines 735-739)
  - Gas stations section had broken conditional with mismatched parens
  - Orphaned code fragments from bad merge/edit
- Added null/empty location fallback in `province.py` line 87
- Commit: `a124a0c4` - pushed to master

**What To Watch**:
- Other template sections might have similar corruption (search for `| prores` usages)
- Users with empty string locations in `stats` table (4 found: ft_user, integ_a, integ_b, v)
- Orphaned provinces exist (provinces whose users were deleted)

**Database Findings**:
- 86 users have NULL/empty locations in stats table
- Some test accounts have orphaned data
- proInfra and resources are properly linked for all active users

**Next Steps**:
- Consider cleaning up orphaned province data
- Audit other templates for similar syntax issues
- Add template syntax validation to CI/CD

---

### Session: 2026-02-09

**Task**: Coalition bank withdraw request failure (500) when new members request withdraw + leader panel non-responsiveness

**What Was Done**:
- Fixed incorrect error handling that caused a 500: replaced `redirect(400, ...)` with `error(400, ...)` in `deposit_into_bank()` and `request_from_bank()` to return proper 400 responses for non-members
- Hardened `request_from_bank()` DB INSERT with try/except, logging and a friendly 500 error message on insert failure
- Added `tests/test_coalitions_bank_flow.py` which exercises: create leader, establish coalition, create member, submit bank request, leader accepts, and cleanup
- Commits made locally: `7443c66d` (use error() fix), `8bd353f6` (DB insert error handling) and subsequent test/workflow fixes were committed and pushed (`82e8a1c0`, `f81a4db9`, `6fbc96e6`).
- Added an integration-smoke workflow modification to initialize the DB and run the coalition bank test (`.github/workflows/integration-smoke.yml`) — commit `2f3a413b` (pushed). Integration smoke and CI runs for this commit completed successfully.

**What To Watch**:
- Verify in production after deployment that the leader panel shows bank requests created by new members and that acceptance removes the requests correctly
- Watch logs for any `colBanksRequests insert failed` warnings
- Monitor integration smoke workflow for flakiness and DB init timing

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor CI/Integration and production for any regressions from this change
- Added a scheduled daily smoke job (`.github/workflows/smoke-daily.yml`, commit `70ddd666`) that runs `tests/test_statistics_components.py` to detect regressions early
- Optionally add a UI-level E2E test to validate the leader accept flow from a browser automation perspective

---

**Task**: Market statistics missing components (UI showed no market stats for components)

**What Was Done**:
- Added `components` to the `resources` list in `statistics.py` so market statistics include components
- Updated `templates/statistics.html` to show Components rows in Average/Highest/Lowest tables
- Added integration test `tests/test_statistics_components.py` which inserts a components offer using the designated test account (id 16), visits `/statistics`, and asserts the Components row and price appear; the test logs in the client via session and cleans up the offer afterwards
- Commits: `7b0f5711` (fix + test added), `e757cea8` (login fixture adjustment in the test)
- Updated `.github/workflows/integration-smoke.yml` to include `tests/test_statistics_components.py` (commit `9dc55699`) and pushed the change
- Integration smoke run for commit `9dc55699` completed successfully (run id: `21847874476`)
- Verified the new test passes locally and pushed the commits; CI ran and reported success

**What To Watch**:
- Ensure the integration-smoke workflow includes tests that surface market statistics regressions (add if missing)
- Monitor the statistics page in production for expected Components averages once offers exist

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor CI runs and production logs for any regressions related to market statistics
- Consider adding a smoke test that inserts a market offer for an under-represented resource to ensure visibility

### Session: 2026-02-10

**Task**: Reproduce and fix "pollution stuck/fluctuating" (player report: nation 4760)

**What Was Done**:
- Fixed an upward-biased rounding bug in `tasks.py` that used `math.ceil()` for building effects and could cause oscillation. Replaced with `int(round(...))` to avoid an upward bias. (File: `tasks.py`)
- Added lightweight telemetry in `generate_province_revenue()` to emit a task metric `province_pollution_delta` when a province's pollution changes by >= 6 percentage points. This is best-effort and non-blocking. (File: `tasks.py`)
- Added a deterministic regression test `tests/test_pollution_stability.py` that uses the designated test account (id 16), sets up a high-pollution province with both pollution sources and sinks, runs `generate_province_revenue()` multiple times, asserts stability, and restores original state. (File: `tests/test_pollution_stability.py`)
- Added a sandbox repro script `scripts/repro_pollution_4760.py` that copies provinces from nation `4760` into the designated test account, runs the revenue task iteratively, records pollution timelines, and cleans up/ restores original state. This was run against production-like data and **left no trace**. (File: `scripts/repro_pollution_4760.py`)
- Verified locally: the regression test passes and the sandbox repro shows provinces that previously oscillated (or were stuck near 98) are now stable (no wild oscillation). Some provinces remain high (98/100) when no sinks exist (expected behavior).

**Commits**:
- `5701b04c` - "repro(pollution): add sandbox repro for nation 4760; rounding fix; telemetry for large pollution deltas"

**What To Watch**:
- Monitor `province_pollution_delta` metrics in task metrics DB and Prometheus (if available) for repeated large deltas that indicate instability.
- Watch CI for the new test; it should pass on all runners. If the test fails in CI due to DB timing, adjust task_runs preconditions in tests.

**Next Steps**:
- If production reports of oscillation continue, investigate the specific province/proInfra mix and consider adding targeted fixes (e.g., making pollution reductions more robust when near-clamped values exist).
- Consider adding an alert rule to surface provinces that toggle > N times in M runs.

### Session: 2026-02-10 (continued)

**Task**: Fix province page 500 errors and Celery background task crashes caused by queries to deleted legacy tables

**What Was Done**:
- Migrated all `proInfra` table queries to normalized `user_buildings + building_dictionary` schema
- Migrated all `resources` table queries to normalized `user_economy + resource_dictionary` schema
- Fixed 9 functions in `tasks.py` covering all core background economy tasks:
  - `rations_distribution_capacity()` - building counts for rations distribution
  - `energy_info()` - province energy production/consumption
  - `food_stats()` - rations availability checks
  - `calc_ti()` - consumer goods for tax income calculation
  - `tax_income()` - consumer goods batch preload and deduction
  - `population_growth()` - rations consumption and row existence
  - `generate_province_revenue()` - most complex: rewrote building/resource preload from column-based to name-based dictionaries, batch resource upserts with resource_id mapping
  - `war_reparation_tax()` - resource looting queries for war reparations
  - `backfill_missing_resources()` - utility to ensure all users have all resource_id rows
- Fixed 3 locations in `province.py`:
  - `create_province()` - removed proInfra INSERT (no longer needed)
  - `get_free_slots()` - city/land slot queries now use user_buildings
  - `province_sell_buy()` resource_stuff() - buy/sell building resource deductions now use user_economy with resource_id lookups
- Fixed scope bug in `task_global_tick()` - moved `validation_start` before conditional to prevent "referenced before assignment" error
- Commit: `da07e06b` - "fix: migrate province routes and celery tasks to normalized schema" - pushed to master

**What To Watch**:
- Monitor Railway logs for any "relation 'proinfra' does not exist" or "column does not exist in resources" errors - should be zero now
- Watch Celery worker logs for successful execution of hourly tasks (tax_income, population_growth, generate_province_revenue)
- Check province management page loads without 500 errors
- Verify building buy/sell operations work correctly (resource deductions/additions)
- War reparations should work correctly when wars end

**Technical Details**:
- Query pattern changed from `SELECT {column} FROM resources` to `SELECT quantity FROM user_economy JOIN resource_dictionary WHERE name = %s`
- Building access changed from `SELECT {building_col} FROM proInfra` to `SELECT quantity FROM user_buildings JOIN building_dictionary WHERE name = %s`
- Batch operations now preload all buildings/resources for all users in chunk, map to dicts, then process in loop
- Resource updates changed from dynamic column-based UPDATE to batch upserts: `INSERT INTO user_economy (user_id, resource_id, quantity) VALUES ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor production for 24-48 hours to ensure all background tasks execute successfully
- If any legacy table references appear in logs, investigate and fix immediately
- Test files in `tests/` directory may reference legacy tables - update if tests fail
- Scripts in `scripts/` directory reference legacy tables but are not on critical path (update as needed)

---

### Session: 2026-03-04 (continued)

**Task**: Fix 4 critical production bugs — attack 500, account 500s, market connection leak, electricity soft-lock

**What Was Done**:

1. **Attack route 500 (units.py)**:
   - Root cause: `Units.rebuild_from_dict()` stored `_unusable_units_cache` in `__dict__` → Flask session. On rebuild, `cls(**dic)` received unknown kwarg → TypeError.
   - Fix: Filter out private attributes (`k.startswith('_')`) before passing to `__init__`.

2. **Account route 500s (countries.py, change.py)**:
   - `delete_own_account()`: `DELETE FROM offers WHERE userid=...` but column is `user_id` → crash.
   - `delete_own_account()`: Missing cleanup of `user_tech`, `policies`, `news` → orphaned data.
   - `change()`: `request.form.get("current_password")` can be `None`, `.encode()` on None → AttributeError.
   - Fix: Corrected column name, added missing DELETEs, null-safe password handling.

3. **Market connection leak (market.py)**:
   - `give_resource()` finally block created a NEW `get_db_connection()` context manager and called `__exit__` on it instead of closing the original `conn`.
   - Fix: Replaced with `conn.close()`.

4. **Electricity soft-lock (variables.py)**:
   - Coal burners required aluminium, oil burners required aluminium, solar fields required steel — but these processing outputs require power plants (circular dependency).
   - Fix: Coal burners → lumber (40k), Oil burners → lumber (60k) + iron (20k), Solar fields → copper (40k) + bauxite (30k). All Tier 1 resources mined without power.

**Commit**: `e24a86d3` — pushed to master

**What To Watch**:
- Verify attack flow works end-to-end: warchoose → waramount → warResult
- Verify delete account, change name, change email all work
- Monitor for connection pool exhaustion (was leaking before fix)
- Verify new players can build coal/oil burners and solar fields with only Tier 1 resources

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor Sentry for any remaining 500 errors on war/account/market routes
- Legacy table references still exist in test files and scripts — update when those are exercised
- Consider adding integration tests for the attack flow and account deletion
---

### Session: 2026-03-06 (continued from Phase 17 economy audit)

**Task**: Player "The_Kaiser" (KR coalition) reports all resources are frozen after commit `110f210d` (5-bug fix deploy). Investigate why resources aren't changing.

**What Was Done**:

**Stage 1: Root Cause Discovery**
- Agent identified that Celery beat process died during the 5-bug fix deploy. The beat script tried to acquire a Redis lock held by the old process, failed (TTL not expired), and exited with `sys.exit(0)`. Railway's `restartPolicyType: ON_FAILURE` doesn't restart processes that exit with code 0 → beat stayed dead for 4+ hours.
- Evidence: task_runs table showed all tasks stopped between 17:00-17:45 UTC (when deploy occurred). game_tick_logs showed old code still running (tick_id 293 had `production_entries: 51`, meaning `BUILDING_PRODUCTION_RESOURCE_MAP` wasn't empty yet).

**Stage 2: Beat Retry Logic Fix**
- Fixed `/scripts/run_beat_if_leader.py`:
  - Added retry loop with backoff: retries acquiring Redis lock for up to `LOCK_TTL * 2` seconds (120s) with 5-second intervals.
  - Changed failure exit from `sys.exit(0)` to `sys.exit(1)` so Railway restarts on failure.
  - Added lock refresh loop while beat runs to keep it alive.

**Stage 3: Additional Bugs Fixed During Investigation**
- **Dict mutation bug in tasks.py** (lines ~2161, 2313, 2320): `plus`, `eff`, `minus`, `effminus` dicts from `variables.NEW_INFRA` were being mutated in-place (e.g., `plus["energy"] += 6`, `eff["happiness"] *= 1.3`). Values would compound across building loop iterations and task runs, eventually producing astronomically wrong values. Fixed by using `dict()` copies before modifications.
- **tax_income cg_map key bug** (line ~855): Query returns `user_id` column but code used `row.get("id")` → all CG values mapped to `cg_map[None]`. Tax income CG consumption was completely broken. Fixed to use `row.get("user_id")`.
- **conn.rollback() scope bug** (line ~2484): Per-building exception handler called `conn.rollback()` which undid earlier DB writes (e.g., user_economy row ensures). Building loop only modifies in-memory dicts, so rollback was unnecessary and harmful. Removed and replaced with print logging.
- **upgrades.py Blueprint import error** (new in this session): When tasks.py imported `get_upgrades` from upgrades.py, the entire module loaded including `bp = Blueprint(...)`. In Celery worker context (no Flask app), this could fail. Fixed by wrapping `bp` creation in try/except and checking for None in app.py.

**Stage 4: Deployment & Verification**
- Commits:
  - `3f16b2fa` — beat retry, dict mutation, cg_map, rollback fixes
  - `65c5137e` — added `/_admin/trigger_tasks` endpoint for manual task triggering
  - `048db660` — SECRET_KEY fallback for auth
  - `0b96f0c5` — DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET fallback for auth
  - `0fc1a5b8` — upgrades.py Blueprint import fix
- After ~20 minutes, `population_growth` and `execute_trade_agreements` both ran at 21:45 UTC ✅
- At 22:00 UTC: `tax_income`, `global_tick` (*/10), `execute_trade_agreements` (*/15) all fired ✅
- At 22:10, 22:15, 22:20 UTC: background tasks continued firing on schedule ✅
- At 22:25 UTC: `generate_province_revenue` fired for the first time since 17:33 ✅
- Verified new code running: tick 294 showed 0 production entries (double-production bug from commit `110f210d` confirmed fixed), consumption entries working.
- **Issue**: `generate_province_revenue` ran but resources for user 781 didn't change. No resource updates in DB after 22:25 run. Investigated: resources preloaded correctly, buildings mapped correctly, energy check logic correct, but likely import failure when loading `get_upgrades` prevented task completion.

**Stage 5: Import Error Fix & Deployment**
- Root cause: `tasks.py` line 1947 imports `from upgrades import get_upgrades as _get_upgrades`. In Celery worker, `upgrades.py` module-level code runs, including `from flask import Blueprint`. In some environments or after certain Flask versions, importing Flask Blueprint outside app context can fail.
- Fixed by wrapping `bp = Blueprint(...)` in try/except and checking `if upgrades.bp:` in app.py before registering.
- Commit: `0fc1a5b8` — pushed to master
- Deploy should resolve the issue and allow `generate_province_revenue` to complete successfully on the next run at 23:25 UTC.

**What To Watch**:
- At 23:25 UTC: verify `generate_province_revenue` runs and resources actually increase for players
- Monitor Celery worker logs for any import errors related to upgrades or Flask
- If resources still don't change, investigate whether task error handling is suppressing exceptions (check task_runs.error_log, if it exists, or Sentry)
- Verify coalition bank requests and market offers still function (also use upgrades module indirectly)

**Next Steps**:
- Wait for 23:25 UTC to verify generate_province_revenue completes and updates resources
- If resources change ✅, inform user that issue is resolved and system is producing again
- If resources still don't change ❌, investigate whether:
  1. Task is crashing but not logging (add exception handler logging)
  2. Resource updates aren't committing (check transaction/commit logic)
  3. A different import error is blocking task execution
- Consider adding telemetry to generate_province_revenue to track: provinces processed, resource deltas applied, batch insert counts
- Document the "beat process dies on deploy with exit code 0" issue and solution for future reference

### Session: 2026-03-18

**Task**: 50M gold giveaway delivery to LD + fix revenue display bug

**What Was Done**:

1. **50M Gold Giveaway Delivery**:
   - Sent 50,000,000 gold to giveaway winner "Donnerkrawall" (Discord) / **ld_real** (in-game, user ID 69697533)
   - Used `admin_add_resource()` to add gold — updated `stats.gold` from 40,010,376 → 90,010,376
   - Verified delivery via DB query

2. **Revenue Display Bug Fix (countries.py + country.html)**:
   - **Bug 1 — Coalition tax not shown**: `get_revenue()` did not account for coalition tax. LD is in "Leviathan" coalition (colid 86) with 20% tax rate. Display showed ~17.6M net but actual income after tax was ~13.9M (matching LD's reported "12m"). Fixed by adding coalition tax lookup from `coalitions_legacy + colNames` tables and deducting from displayed net money. Added `revenue["coalition_tax"]` field.
   - **Bug 2 — CG formula mismatch**: Display used legacy `pop/80000` formula while actual `tax_income()` task uses demographic-based consumption (`FEATURE_DEMOGRAPHIC_CONSUMPTION`). Fixed by adding demographic branch to `get_revenue()` with distribution capacity check, falling back to legacy formula when feature flag is off.
   - **Template update**: Added coalition tax line item in red on country page (`country.html`) after "Monetary net" row.

3. **Discord Response**:
   - Posted message in #50m-giveaway channel explaining the fix to LD and confirming giveaway delivery

**Commits**:
- `25a4211f` — "fix: revenue display now accounts for coalition tax & demographic CG consumption" — pushed to master

**Files Changed**:
- `countries.py` — `get_revenue()` function: added coalition tax deduction, demographic CG formula
- `templates/country.html` — added coalition tax display row

**What To Watch**:
- Verify LD's country page now shows ~13.9M net (down from ~17.6M) after deploy
- Other players in coalitions with tax rates should also now see accurate net revenue
- The demographic CG formula and legacy formula converge for most players but could diverge for edge cases with unusual demographic distributions

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor player feedback on revenue accuracy
- Consider adding coalition tax rate to the revenue breakdown tooltip or info panel
- Legacy table references still exist in test files and scripts — update when exercised
